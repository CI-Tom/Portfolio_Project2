# Play Tic Tac Toe

This website allows two freinds to play a game of Tic Tac Toe against each other.
The game starts with player X always having the first turn.

Users must decide themselves who will be player X and who is PLayer O.
When player X is reeady, the game is started by clicking on a cell in the grid.

## Features 

This website is designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and allows two players to compete against each other in a game of Tic Tac Toe.

### Existing Features

- __HEADER__

  - The header is designed using the Google Font 'Bungee Spice' with a transparent background to allow the HTML black background be visible.
  - This font gives the impression of a retro style game and the contrast between the font's bright colours and black background make the heading stand out.

- __The Game Area__

  - This area allows the users to play the game. Users must decide who is player X and who is player O before starting as the default starting player is always player X. 
  - A message is shown below the main game board that show's who's turn it is next.
  - When a player wins, the message displays a message showing which player has won. In the event of a tie, the message displays the text 'Draw'.

- __Restart Game__

  - There is a button below the message area that allows users to restart the game on completion.
  - The button is styled using the same theme as the header and there is a hover effect that changes the cursor to a pointer.
  - The transform method is used to give the effect that the button jumps slightly when hovered over.

- __Future Features to Implement__

- A score area to keep track of each player's number of games won.
- More games

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 
  - The styling follows a similar theme to the header but in reverse. I used the color picker in MS paint and took the colors from the 'Bungee Spice' font and madde a background that transitions between those two colors.

## Testing 

The site was tested using the Chrome in-built developer features and also tested on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 and iPhone 8 plus. Tested the website on multiple browsers also, including Chrome, Edge, Firfox, Brave.

The website looks the same on all browsers used for testing but starts to break down when screen width goes below 570px.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator$link)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
